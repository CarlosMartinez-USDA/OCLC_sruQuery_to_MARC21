# OCLC_sruQuery_to_MARC21
To remove the "zing" (or zs) prefixed elements and create individual MARC records. The archiveFile records produced from this transformation are direct copies of all the elements within the MARC namespace; beginning with record. The originalFile records produced add the marc prefix to each element making it easier to transform into other formats including MARC21 and MODS.
